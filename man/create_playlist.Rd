\item{name}{Required. String containing the name for the new playlist, for example \code{"Your Coolest Playlist"}. This name does not need to be unique; a user may have several playlists with the same name.}

\item{public}{Optional. Boolean. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE} the playlist will be public. If \code{FALSE} it will be private. To be able to create private playlists, the user must have granted the \code{playlist-modify-private} \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#list-of-scopes}{scope}}

\item{collaborative}{Optional. Boolean. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE} the playlist will be collaborative. Note that to create a collaborative playlist you must also set \code{public} to \code{FALES}. To create collaborative playlists you must have granted \code{playlist-modify-private} and \code{playlist-modify-public} \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#list-of-scopes}{scopes}.}

\item{description}{Optional. String containing the playlist description as displayed in Spotify Clients and in the Web API.}

\item{authorization}{Required. A valid access token from the Spotify Accounts service. See the \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/}{Web API authorization Guide} for more details. Defaults to \code{spotifyr::get_spotify_authorization_code()}. The access token must have been issued on behalf of the current user. \cr
Creating a public playlist for a user requires authorization of the \code{playlist-modify-public} scope; creating a private playlist requires the \code{playlist-modify-private} scope. See \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#list-of-scopes}{Using Scopes}.}
