\usage{
get_recommendations_all(track_ids, valence = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{track_ids}{A vector containing the IDs of the tracks you'd like recommendations for}

\item{valence}{The target valence for the recommendations}

}
\description{
This is a wrapper for the get_recommendations() function, which provides a workaround for the limit of 5 seed tracks per recommendation call. The function splits a supplied vector of track IDs into subsets of length 5, then applies a get_recommendations() call, 5 tracks at a time. This should generate a data frame of recommended tracks, with length equal to the supplied vector of track ids.
