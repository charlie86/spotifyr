Description: A wrapper for pulling track audio features from the
  'Spotify' Web API <http://developer.spotify.com/web-api> in bulk. 
  By automatically batching API requests, it allows you to enter an artist's 
  name and retrieve their entire discography in seconds, along with audio 
  features and track/album popularity metrics. You can also pull song and 
  playlist information for a given 'Spotify' user (including yourself!).
