\arguments{
\item{limit}{Optional. The target size of the list of recommended tracks. For seeds with unusually small pools or when highly restrictive filtering is applied, it may be impossible to generate the requested number of recommended tracks. Debugging information for such cases is available in the response. Default: 20. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 100.}

\item{market}{Optional. An \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2}{ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code} or the string \code{from_token}. Provide this parameter if you want to apply \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/track-relinking-guide}{Track Relinking}. Because \code{min_*}, \code{max_*} and \code{target_*} are applied to pools before relinking, the generated results may not precisely match the filters applied. Original, non-relinked tracks are available via the \code{linked_from} attribute of the \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/track-relinking-guide}{relinked track response}.}

\item{seed_artists}{A character vector of \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/#spotify-uris-and-ids}{Spotify IDs} for seed artists. Up to 5 seed values may be provided in any combination of \code{seed_artists}, \code{seed_tracks} and \code{seed_genres}.}

\item{seed_genres}{A character vector of any genres in the set of \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/browse/get-recommendations/#available-genre-seeds}{available genre seeds}. Up to 5 seed values may be provided in any combination of \code{seed_artists}, \code{seed_tracks} and \code{seed_genres}.}

\item{seed_tracks}{A character vector of \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/#spotify-uris-and-ids}{Spotify IDs} for a seed track. Up to 5 seed values may be provided in any combination of \code{seed_artists}, \code{seed_tracks} and \code{seed_genres}.}
