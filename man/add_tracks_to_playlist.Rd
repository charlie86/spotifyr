A maximum of 100 tracks can be added in one request.}

\item{position}{Optional. Integer indicating the position to insert the tracks, a zero-based index. For example, to insert the tracks in the first position: \code{position = 0}; to insert the tracks in the third position: \code{position = 2} . If omitted, the tracks will be appended to the playlist. Tracks are added in the order they are listed in the query string or request body.}

\item{authorization}{Required. A valid access token from the Spotify Accounts service. See the \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/}{Web API authorization Guide} for more details. Defaults to \code{spotifyr::get_spotify_authorization_code()}. The access token must have been issued on behalf of the current user. \cr
Adding tracks to the current user’s public playlists requires authorization of the \code{playlist-modify-public} scope; adding tracks to the current user’s private playlist (including collaborative playlists) requires the \code{playlist-modify-private} scope. See \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#list-of-scopes}{Using Scopes}.}
