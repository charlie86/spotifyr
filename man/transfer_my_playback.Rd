Note that a value of \code{FALSE} for the \code{play} parameter when also transferring to another \code{device_id} will not pause playback. To ensure that playback is paused on the new device you should send a pause command to the currently active device before transferring to the new \code{device_id}.}

See the \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/}{Web API authorization Guide} for more details. Defaults to \code{spotifyr::get_spotify_access_token()}.
