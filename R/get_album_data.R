#' Retrieve the entire discography of an artist with the lyrics of each song and the associated audio information. Returns the song data as a nested tibble. This way we can easily see each album, artist, and song title before expanding our data.
#'
#' @param artist The quoted name of the artist. Spelling matters, capitalization does not.
#' @param albums A character vector of album names. Spelling matters, capitalization does not
