\usage{
get_playlist(
  playlist_id,
  fields = NULL,
  market = NULL,
  authorization = get_spotify_access_token()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{playlist_id}{Required. The \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/#spotify-uris-and-ids}{Spotify ID} for the playlist.}

\item{fields}{Optional. Filters for the query: a comma-separated list of the fields to return. If omitted, all fields are returned. For example, to get just the playlistâ€™s description and URI: \cr
\code{fields = c("description", "uri")} \cr A dot separator can be used to specify non-reoccurring fields, while parentheses can be used to specify reoccurring fields within objects. For example, to get just the added date and user ID of the adder: \cr
\code{fields = "tracks.items(added_at,added_by.id)"} \cr Use multiple parentheses to drill down into nested objects, for example: \cr
\code{fields = "tracks.items(track(name,href,album(name,href)))"} \cr Fields can be excluded by prefixing them with an exclamation mark, for example: \cr
\code{fields = "tracks.items(track(name,href,album(!name,href)))"}}

\item{market}{Optional. \cr
An ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code or the string \code{"from_token"}. Provide this parameter if you want to apply \href{https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/track-relinking-guide/}{Track Relinking}}
