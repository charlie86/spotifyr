# spotifyr

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/spotifyr?color=brightgreen)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=spotifyr)
![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/spotifyr?color=brightgreen)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    collapse = TRUE,
    comment = "#>",
    fig.path = "man/figures/README-"
)
```

## Overview
spotifyr is a wrapper for pulling track audio features and other information from Spotify's Web API in bulk. By automatically batching API requests, it allows you to enter an artist's name and retrieve their entire discography in seconds, along with Spotify's audio features and track/album popularity metrics. You can also pull song and playlist information for a given Spotify User (including yourself!).

## Installation
Development version (recommended)
```r
devtools::install_github('charlie86/spotifyr')
```
The development version now includes functions from the `geniusR` package from [Josiah Parry](https://github.com/JosiahParry/geniusR).

CRAN version 1.0.0 (Note: this is somewhat outdated, as it takes extra time to submit and pass CRAN checks)
```r
install.packages('spotifyr')
```

## Authentication
First, set up a Dev account with Spotify to access their Web API [here](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications). This will give you your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. Once you have those, you can pull your access token into R with `get_spotify_access_token()`. 

The easiest way to authenticate is to set your credentials to the System Environment variables `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`. The default arguments to `get_spotify_access_token()` (and all other functions in this package) will refer to those. Alternatively, you can set them manually and make sure to explicitly refer to your access token in each subsequent function call.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')
Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')

access_token <- get_spotify_access_token()
```

## Usage
### What was The Beatles' favorite key?
```{r load_packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
library(spotifyr)
beatles <- get_artist_audio_features('the beatles')
```
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

beatles %>% 
    count(key_mode, sort = TRUE) %>% 
    head(5) %>% 
    kable()
```

### Get your most recently played tracks
```{r}
get_my_recently_played(limit = 5) %>% 
    select(track_name, artist_name, album_name, played_at_utc) %>% 
    kable()
```


### Find your all time favorite artists
```{r}
get_my_top_artists(time_range = 'long_term', limit = 5) %>% 
    select(artist_name, artist_genres) %>% 
    rowwise %>% 
    mutate(artist_genres = paste(artist_genres, collapse = ', ')) %>% 
    ungroup %>% 
    kable()
```

### Find your favorite tracks at the moment
```{r}
get_my_top_tracks(time_range = 'short_term', limit = 5) %>% 
    select(track_name, artist_name, album_name) %>% 
    kable()
```

### What's the most joyful Joy Division song?
My favorite audio feature has to be "valence," a measure of musical positivity.
```{r, results = 'hide'}
joy <- get_artist_audio_features('joy division')
```
```{r}
joy %>% 
    arrange(-valence) %>% 
    select(track_name, valence) %>% 
    head(5) %>% 
    kable()
```

Now if only there was some way to plot joy...

### Joyplot of the emotional rollercoasters that are Joy Division's albums
```{r}
library(ggjoy)

ggplot(joy, aes(x = valence, y = album_name)) + 
    geom_joy() + 
    theme_joy() +
    ggtitle("Joyplot of Joy Division's joy distributions", subtitle = "Based on valence pulled from Spotify's Web API with spotifyr")
```

## Parallelization
`get_artist_audio_features()`, `get_artist_albums()`, `get_album_tracks()`, `get_playlist_tracks()`, and `get_user_playlists()` can run in parallel using the `furrr` package. To enable this feature, set `parallelize = TRUE`. You can also adjust the evaluation strategy by setting `future_plan`, which accepts a string matching one of the strategies implemented in `future::plan()` (defaults to `"multiprocess"`).

## Sentify: A Shiny app
This [app](http://rcharlie.net/sentify/), powered by spotifyr, allows you to visualize the energy and valence (musical positivity) of all of Spotify's artists and playlists.
